Paper: https://www.brinckerhoff.org/clements/2214-csc530/Files/sgsl-autograder-2013.pdf

# Update 1

Read the paper fully and seems like a general overview of their project and their experience in using it.

Don't see much clear synthesis as they define all their translations beforehand, but it does make me hopeful that I can do some more experimenting and implementation.

# Update 2

Looking for leads on implementation and going to read this lectur material that goes over CEGIS some more https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/SynthesisCourse/Lecture10.htm

Also going to go over this short paper to gain insight into SKETCH https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/papers/Solar-Lezama09.pdf
